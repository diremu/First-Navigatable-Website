# First-Navigatable-Website
**This was my attempt at creating a navigatable website that is hosted by a third party**
In this Repository I will make my first attempt at using GitHub and My native Programming Skills to enable me to create a well functioning site. However I hope that I do not run out of patience or hope for this.
While I constantly pursue my career in Software Engineering with a Computer Science degree, I hope to at least get a Job within 3 years so that I will have enough experience to be selected as a Junior SW or even a SW if my CV is good enough.
